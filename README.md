# Implementation of the Ritt-Wu's algorithm.

This project implements the Characteristic set method developed by Ritt and Wu. We use Haskell programming language through a parallel programming style.  

## Getting Started

This proyect run benchmarks using cabal new-bench

### Prerequisites

The project is under constant development using GHC 8.6.4, compiler under this version doesn't work correctly. We recommend use version higher than 8.6.x. Also, the proyect execution need the cabal (recommended) or stack CLT.
## Running the tests

The test are evaluated using cabal new-bench, for testing purposes the default test are 10 samples.

## Deployment

The project is under development.

## Built With

* [Massiv](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/massiv-0.4.4.0/docs/Data-Massiv-Array.html) - Haskell library to manage parallesm using OS threads.

## Authors

* **Jose Seraquive** - *Initial work*
